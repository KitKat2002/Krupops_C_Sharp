# Krupops_C_Sharp

This is where I will keep projects involving the coding language C#

In it I have built a calculator that finds the cost of shipping based on package weight/size (Shipping project)

A program that finds if someone is eligible for insurance (InsuranceProject)

A program that allows people to submit a daily report to a website (DailyReport)

And other small miscellaneous projects
